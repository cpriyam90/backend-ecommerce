## Usage
A back-end application for an e-commerce website. A working Express.js API was used and configured to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Using latest technologies, this application will enable an ecommerce website to be competetive.


## Video-Link
Please note I ran out of the five minute limit for screencastify to record my demo in one video which is why there are two videos included for this assignment. In the first video, I start the application by seeding the database, creating the schema, and start the application from my terminal. The first video shows the GET,PUSH,PUT,DEL for Categories and Tags. In the second video I demonstrate GET,PUSH,PUT,DEL only for Products since I ran out of recording time in the first video.
